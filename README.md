## About This Package
### Creator
Cody Nichoson

### Overview 
This package contains two unrelated packages. The first package is called `diff_drive` and serves to create, simulate, and control a 
custom robot model so that it performs flips in Gazebo. The second package is called `arm_move` and utilizes MoveIt! to control a 
PincherX 100 robot arm and perform simple motion planning capabilities in both simulation and the real world.

For usage instructions and further information for each package, please consult their individual README.md files.
